## Bio
Currently building ML/AI solutions in the Maritime intelligcence domain.   
Previous work includes working at the intersection of climate science and risk management to help communities build resilience, adapt, and mitigate against current and future effects of climate change. I have an undergrad in Civil engineering, followed by a 2+year stint as a consultant in the tech sector. Moved on to studying extreme weather across Canada in grad school followed by 1.5 years of deep ocean data collection and management. Now, I am back in the role of a consultant, but this time in the climate sector.

I am a big proponent of open source and open science and try my best to contribute to these efforts in any way possible.
